ExplorerNavigationButton
========================

ExplorerNavigationButton is a simple control with the appearance of the explorer's navigation buttons.
It automatically detects your OS version and chooses the correct style. Currently there are only styles for Windows Vista/7 and for Windows 8, on every other OS the default style is used.
